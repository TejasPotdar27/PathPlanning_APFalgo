# PathPlanning_APFalgo
Overview

This MATLAB implementation demonstrates a robust path planning solution using the Artificial Potential Field (APF) algorithm, specifically designed for automotive applications. The algorithm enables autonomous agents to navigate from a start position to a goal while intelligently avoiding obstacles in a 2D environment.

Key features:

Real-time path planning with obstacle avoidance
Sensor simulation with configurable range
Interactive environment setup
Collision detection and prevention
Visualization of forces, sensor rays, and navigation path
Algorithm Background

The APF algorithm creates a virtual potential field where:

The goal generates an attractive force
Obstacles generate repulsive forces
The robot navigates along the resultant force vector
This implementation includes enhancements for automotive scenarios:

Goal Navigation Radius of Obstacle Nearness (GNRON)
Adaptive force scaling near obstacles
Collision prevention with safety margins
Getting Started

Prerequisites
